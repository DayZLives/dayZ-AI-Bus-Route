AI controlled bus route for dayZ


DayZ AI controlled Bus Route System - Made for DayZ Epoch please ask permission to use/edit/distrubute email axeman@thefreezer.co.uk / gregory.andrew@gmail.com


This script creates an invulnerable bus, driver and drivers mate. The bus drives from NE of Chernarus to SW and loops around. 

Planned Updates / Started: Dynamic removal of 'junk' in the road and removal of zombies / animals that halt the bus on it's route..

In Current Development: A random bus stop system that takes input, I.E. number of bus stops, radius of route, and generates a random bus route for each bus created.

Updates: Since the original release of this the script has been simplified in that the bus and crew are now invulnerable, anybody taking over the drivers seat is ejected after a warning.

Known Issues: Beeping of the bus horn,when near a survivor, is still a work in progress (have had it working).

For support and bug reports please use: http://opendayz.net/threads/dayz-arma-ai-controlled-bus-route.10057/ or email (one of the above).
