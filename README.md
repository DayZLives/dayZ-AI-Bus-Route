This script creates an invulnerable bus, driver and drivers mate. The bus drives from NE of Chernarus to SW and loops around. 

Planned Updates: Dynamic removal of 'junk' in the road and removal of zombies / animals that halt the bus on it's route..

In Development: A random bus stop system that takes input, I.E. number of bus stops, radius of route, and generates a random bus route for each bus created.

Updates: Since the original release of this the script has been simplified in that the bus and crew are now invulnerable, anybody tsaking over the drivers seat is ejected after a warning.
